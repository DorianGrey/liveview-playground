# ElixirPhoenix
This is an implementation of the `LiveServer` tech using the [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) in Elixir.

# Get started for dev

* Install Elixir and Erlang OTP as described in the specific [installation docs](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
* (Optional) Install the Phoenix generator as described in their [installation docs](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html)
* Start the required services using `docker compose up`
* Prepare the database:
    * `mix ecto.create`
    * `mix ecto.migrate`
* Start the Phoenix server via `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
